Movie API - README
This README file provides an overview of the Movie API project. It covers the implementation details and key concepts explored during the development process. The project was created as part of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path and was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Description
The Movie API project is a solo project developed to showcase the understanding of various concepts related to web development, including callbacks, async code, functions as first-class objects, APIs, promises, array methods like .filter(), and method chaining.

The goal of the project is to create a movie application that utilizes a Movie API to fetch movie data and display it to the user. The application allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and add movies to their watchlist. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore and discover movies.

Implementation Details
The project incorporates the following concepts and features:

Callbacks: The usage of callbacks is demonstrated throughout the project to handle asynchronous operations and ensure the execution of code when specific actions or events occur.

Asynchronous Code: The project utilizes asynchronous code techniques to fetch movie data from the Movie API, ensuring smooth user experience and non-blocking operations.

Functions as First-Class Objects: JavaScript functions are treated as first-class objects, enabling their usage as variables, parameters, and return values. This approach allows for modular and flexible code design.

API Integration: The project interacts with a Movie API to retrieve movie data. It demonstrates how to make API requests, handle responses, and extract relevant information for display.

Promises: Promises are employed to handle asynchronous operations and manage the flow of data. The project explores the three states of promises: pending, fulfilled, and rejected, and demonstrates their usage in handling API requests.

Array Methods: Various array methods, such as .filter(), are utilized to manipulate and filter movie data based on specific criteria. These methods allow for efficient data processing and enhance the user's ability to search and explore movies.

Method Chaining: The project demonstrates the concept of method chaining, where multiple methods are applied sequentially to an object or data structure. This approach results in concise and readable code that performs multiple operations in a single statement.

Learning Outcomes
During the development of the Movie API project, several important learnings were acquired:

Solid understanding of asynchronous programming and the importance of handling async operations appropriately.
Familiarity with using callbacks to handle async code execution and ensure proper sequencing of actions.
Understanding the role of functions as first-class objects and their flexibility in building modular and reusable code.
Knowledge of how to integrate external APIs into a web application and fetch data from them.
Proficiency in working with promises and understanding their role in managing async operations.
Mastery of various array methods like .filter() to manipulate and filter data efficiently.
Ability to chain methods and perform multiple operations in a concise and readable manner.
How to Run the Project
To run the Movie API project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
Ensure you have a web server set up. You can use tools like Live Server or run a local server using Node.js.
Start the web server and open the project in your web browser.
Enjoy exploring and interacting with the Movie API project!
